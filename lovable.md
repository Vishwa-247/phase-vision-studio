Here actually I am trying to do something here, okay. Like the thing is, firstly the website, okay — I will try to give you the final output of this website here.

Okay, like the thing is to create a lovable file, okay, like the frontend here. Okay, like the thing is first, the main goal is agents’ behavior here, okay. Like the thing is everything is agents here, okay, like they should work like agents and be connected here, okay.

here evry time i refreshes the page then the toiast message is comming here ok like welcome to the thing bla bla bla  make sure this shoudl be fixed ehre ok

Like here I have some issues, okay, like they are:
In this route /profile-builder the thing is, like, there is a file upload here. Like it will take the resumes here, okay, like it’s just like profile building here. But the thing is, if a user uploads the resume, automatically what should happen is the backend we are using should parse this resume and get the details according to the profile format here. And then directly it should ask with a toast message for the user to auto-fill those details in the frontend, okay. These details should be visible in the frontend here, okay, and these should be reflected in the backend here also.
And the thing is the resume preview — there is also a resume preview here, okay, but I want the uploaded resume preview also so that users can see them here, okay. And the thing is we are going to make this as an agent. Before that, the resume which we uploaded here should have a preview and delete option, okay. It should work perfectly, okay. If the user deletes the resume it should ask twice, because again we can’t even get it back. And then if he says okay, then it should be deleted from the database and also from the frontend here, okay.
And here the user should have an option to edit their details here, okay. Like there is a Save Changes button towards the right, then towards the left there should be an option here — Edit Changes. And the thing is, in the frontend there are no details present even though we have saved the details in the database here. So in the frontend it should fill the details here, okay, like what we have saved in the database here, okay.
And every time when I come to the profile button, it is loading. Remove that loading here, okay. Like make sure to keep the inline loading just like example AJAX. Instead of the entire page loading, only those should load, okay.
And what this agent does is — this is connected to the interview agent, okay. Like it will give the profile details and entire details to the interview agents. Like when you select the technical interview here, okay, like what project you have done, what skills you have, and what you have in everything — it will give that to the technical interview agent here, okay.
And the print and export — this is worse here, okay. Like the responsiveness is too worse here, okay. Like the thing is the resume should come on the entire page here, okay, like clean and clear resume should print here, okay, not like when the page is changed the resume is not fitting in the print and export thing, okay.
Okay, in the skills section the responsiveness should be corrected here. And the thing is everything like education, skills, projects, and certificates — and make sure to keep a refresh button so that if we press that refresh button it should reload manually, okay. This should be on the top in this page, /profile-builder, beside this “90% Complete” and above the bar, okay.

This is also an agent here: /resume-analyzer — some agent behavior here, okay.
Now we will work on this resume analyzer thing, this route /resume-analyzer. Now here we have many things, okay, like we need to fix them. First thing is, for this we’re going to do some history part thing here, okay — like the same as ChatGPT, with new chat and previous chat. Like here, users can have different kinds of resumes, okay. Like if the resume analysis is done here, if the user wants to analyze another resume, then the previous resume analysis should be saved just like the sidebar here, okay. But not exactly like the sidebar — that looks bad here, okay, so make sure we need to design that here properly, okay.
Okay, after entering the job role and job description, if we press the continue-to-upload, there should be a back button here, okay. Like “back to the job role thing” or “change something” like that, okay.
And here, after entering the job role, there is an upload kind of thing here, okay, like the user will be able to upload the resume here. So here actually, in the user profile, like if he already uploaded the resume over there, then here it should ask whether we should use this resume. And here it should show the preview, okay — like the entire preview of the resume he uploaded there, okay. Like fetch it through any ID, okay, make sure we need to do this perfectly here, okay. Like there could be some misunderstandings here, okay.
And if the user wants to check for another resume, another one, then he can also do it, okay. So create an S3 bucket separately for this, okay — like this should be just for checking, okay. This should be perfect here, okay, like I will manually delete the content here which is present in the database here, okay. Like create the things perfectly here, okay.
And dual things here: if user resume is “yes,” then it should take that; if not, it should allow the user to upload the resume he wants to check here, okay.
And here, if we upload the resume here, then it should process the things here, okay. The document preview is there over the tab but nothing is previewing over there, okay. Make sure to check that too, okay.
And extracted content here: it should show the entire extracted content here, okay. And the main thing — it should show the name, email, and phone number from the resume. And the content should be in the format. And make sure for this extraction we are using some PyPDF and other things, but I want this perfectly, okay, like everything, okay, every word and every letter here, okay. Like here use some other things also like Tesseract and other things for robustness, okay. And the extracted thing should be visible for the user here, okay — the entire content, okay, over there, okay.
After that, the thing is I have some resources here like the action words which we use in the resume so that it could add some value. And basically how this analyze should be: first the actual analyze thing should work, after that the action verbs thing should work. The actual analyze should work along with giving the rating for the action words and STAR methodologies also, okay. Like I will give you the action words which we are going to use in the resume so that it could be easy, okay.
And the STAR methodologies also, okay. Like for each line, how can we use the STAR methodologies? Also we should say: the action words also, how can we use them. And the line which they have in the resume and the correct line in the action words or STAR methodology should also be shown here, okay.
And after analysis, the output we got should be like this, okay. I am saying this keeping the present one in mind, okay. Like after analysis we will get the overall score, job match score, and ATS score here. Along with that we should get the action words score and STAR methodology score also, okay.
Like after that, we have preview below that scores — like here, if it shows the resume preview then it could be better, okay. And this previewer should be on one side, okay, and extracted content should be clear, okay, like everything should be clear over there, okay — everything as I mentioned above over there, okay.
And then below that AI analyze summary. Beside that score like 55/100, beside this keep an info icon like mention how you are giving that score, okay, like a valid point, okay, over there. And overall score on top screen — that’s nice here. Strengths and areas of improvements are good here.
And here we are going to add the action words analysis. Like here, if the resume is not up to the mark here, like here it should show the line here and it could be rewritten as the updated line with the action words here, okay. This one like this for everything, like if needed it should show here, okay.
And make sure everything should be saved in the database, okay. Make sure everything should be saved here, okay.
And the history part we have discussed for this — like everything it should show, okay, like keep them in info here, okay.
And after this, the STAR methodology: like if the content in the resume is following the STAR methodology, if yes, okay; if no, then rewrite the actual one, showing the resume one, okay. This one thing.
And next as it is — it is perfect, okay. Found keywords and missing keywords and AI recommendations for product manager and other things, okay. Make sure everything should be saved in the database here, okay.
If user presses analyze for another role, then it should go to the home page over there. Make sure to keep a history button — if user presses the history button then the analysis page should come here, okay. Like make sure to keep any ID for that, okay, for analysis page the content in that and everything should be clear over there, okay. Follow this, okay. This should repeat here, okay.
we are fine if we use the rag here also ok

Now we will try to build /dsa-sheet.
The chatbot must be able to access everything on this site — page data, web search results, and external resources — and it must understand the context of each page (what’s on the page, which sections exist, etc.). The chatbot should support web search (for example via Brave search API or another web-search provider) so when a user asks “what is DSA?” or “why learn DSA?”, it explains in detail.
The bot should also answer questions about the sheet’s content (e.g., “best DSA YouTube channels”, “Shriver’s resources”, company problems) and know the problems available in the sheet (company-wise and topic-wise). Put these expectations into the system prompt.
UI details: change hover colors and the difficulty label colors. Difficulty labels (easy / medium / hard) currently have white text on blue background — change them so the text is white and the background is green for easy, yellow for medium, and red for hard.
Feedback: collect feedback after interactions and store feedback in the database. Add a fourth frontend tab next to Topics / Companies / Favorites named Feedbacks which lists all feedback entries and shows recommendations (YouTube suggestions, etc.). I’ll give the YouTube API key; the app should use it to fetch recommended videos after analyzing feedback and store those recommendations in the DB. Every feedback item must store any related YouTube-recommendation entries and other metadata in a clean format.
The chatbot must be resizable, unique in appearance, and have links to web results. Use an LLM provider (Gemini or similar) and a web-search API (Brave or other). Design the agent so it can train users on DSA and act as an assistant that knows the sheet contents and related resources. Ensure everything is stored cleanly in the database.
