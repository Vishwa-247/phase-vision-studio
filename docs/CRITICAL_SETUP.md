# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SETUP REQUIRED

## Package Lock Issue
**CRITICAL:** Your project is missing `package-lock.json` which prevents Lovable from running.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
```bash
npm install
```

This will generate the required `package-lock.json` file.

## Google Auth Fixed âœ…
- Fixed user initialization trigger for Google auth
- Database will now properly save new users
- Google auth should work correctly now

## Resume Auto-Fill Enhanced âœ…
- Added multiple backend endpoint fallback for better reliability
- Enhanced error handling and debugging
- Resume upload should now work with auto-fill functionality

## Backend Services
Make sure these services are running:
- API Gateway: `http://localhost:8000`
- Profile Service: `http://localhost:8006` 
- Resume Analyzer: `http://localhost:8003`

## Next Steps
1. **Run `npm install` immediately**
2. Test Google auth - should now save users properly
3. Test resume upload in Profile Builder - should auto-fill profile sections
4. Ready for Phase 3 implementation

## Security Warnings (Non-Critical)
- Minor password protection and postgres version warnings
- These don't affect core functionality
- Can be addressed later via Supabase dashboard
